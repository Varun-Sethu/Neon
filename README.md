# Neon

Neon is meant to be a simple and easy to use physics engine for Golang.

## Examples
Example usage of the engine is provided in the "examples" folder, every example is built with [Pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel).



### Todo

Below is a small list of stuff currently in the engine and features intended to be implemented
 - [ ] Make code "not ugly and hacky" :( 
 - [x] Concave Polygon Mesh collider
 - [x] Concave Polygon Collision detection
 - [x] Concave Polygon Collision resolution
 - [ ] Universal forces (gravity, etc.)
 - [ ] Circular collider
 - [ ] Pill collider
 - [ ] Phasing for collision detection
 - [ ] Proper spatial division (Quad Trees)
 - [ ] Rigid body constraints
 - [ ] Rag-doll Physics
 
 The library also features a simple 2D/3D Vector structure as well as a 2x2 and 3x3 Matrix struct.
